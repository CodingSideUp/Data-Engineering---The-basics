The Data Engineering project was planned, implemented and executed as part of my academic curricula during my Masters program of Applied Data Science and Analytics at SRH HOCHSCHULE, HEIDELBERG.
The project includes web scraping from websites which had recips of food.
The web scraping has been accomplished using SELENIUM and BEAUTIFUL SOUP, both in Python.
The data which has been collected from the web scraping is available in the repository.
Tailscale VPN has then been used to connect 4 UBUNTU VM's as nodes.
The connection of these nodes and reflection of master and slave nodes can be seen in the screenshots.
SQLite Database has then been created using a script in Python, which is then run on HADOOP, a DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM
Queries to extract data from SQLite has also been implemented and screenshots are also available.

All suggestions and comments are welcome.
